    "Single GPU · No TRL or Verl · Efficient · 3B Base Model · Full Parameter Tuning Implementation of R1-zero training.\n",
    "\n",
    "Inspired by [TinyZero](https://github.com/Jiayi-Pan/TinyZero) and [Mini-R1](https://www.philschmid.de/mini-deepseek-r1), but designed to be **simpler**, **cleaner**, and **faster**, with every line of code visible and understandable."

    "R1-Zero is arguably the more interesting contribution from the DeepSeek R1 paper. The core idea: take a freshly pre-trained LLM (straight out of the unsupervised pretraining oven) and continue its training using reinforcement learning *without* any human feedback or supervision. The result? A model that starts showing emergent behaviors like self-reflection, verification, backtracking that researchers have tried to bake into LLMs using handcrafted tricks and inductive biases, at least since O1.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we’ll build an R1-Zero-style training loop **from scratch**. The goal is to create a crystal-clear, hackable foundation for RL-style LLM training; one that gives you a bird’s-eye view of every moving part and how they fit together. Perfect for playing around, extending, or hacking.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why another R1-Zero implementation?\n",
    "\n",
    "There are already great implementations like [TinyZero](https://github.com/Jiayi-Pan/TinyZero) and [Mini-R1](https://www.philschmid.de/mini-deepseek-r1). But they rely on full-fledged RL libraries (like `trl` or `verl`) to handle training.\n",
    "\n",
    "These libraries exist for good reason; efficient RL training for LLMs sits at the crossroads of scalable training and fast inference. Making that work takes a lot of engineering. But that also means the internals are often abstracted away, hard to read, and even harder to tweak.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook is different: **no abstractions, no hiding**. You’ll see everything, top to bottom. A lightweight, readable codebase that still follows best practices and runs efficiently on a single GPU.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is this notebook, exactly?\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll train a base LLM using RL to solve a reasoning-heavy algorithmic task. The setup:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Model**: Qwen2.5 3B-Base  \n",
    "- **Dataset**: Countdown-Tasks-3to4  \n",
    "- **Algorithm**: GRPO (a variant of policy gradient)\n",
    "\n",
    "Yes, the task is a bit toy-ish—but it captures the essence of R1-Zero: emergent behaviors like self-reflection, verification, backtracking, even language-switching. This setup is ideal for rapid prototyping and experimentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Who is this notebook for?\n",
    "\n",
    "- Anyone interested in RL training for LLMs  \n",
    "- Researchers, especially the ones in academia, exploring reasoning in language models\n",
    "\n",
    "### What should I know before jumping in?\n",
    "\n",

   ]
  },
  {
   "cell_type": "markdown",
   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "The goal is to train a base LLM to **reason** in a way that allows it to **reevaluate** its own outputs and **improve** them, all without human supervision. The DeepSeek R1 paper proposes a surprisingly simple recipe to achieve this, and that's exactly what we'll implement in this notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Recipe\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's the high-level procedure:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Start** with a base LLM and a dataset containing problem prompts paired only with their *final answers* (no intermediate reasoning steps).  \n",
    "2. For each iteration $i = 0$ to `NUM_ITERATIONS`:\n",
    "   - Sample a batch of prompts $\\{x_i\\}_{i=1}^N$ from the dataset.\n",
    "   - For each prompt, sample $G$ responses from the model:  \n",
    "     $ y_1, y_2, \\cdots, y_G \\sim \\pi_\\theta(y|x) $\n",
    "\n",
    "     These $G$ responses form what is called a *group* in GRPO.\n",
    "   - Compute a reward $R_i$ for each response and normalize them tocalculate the GRPO advantage within each group.\n",
    "   - Create a list of $N \\times G$ episodes, i.e., pairs of $(x_i, y_i)$ along with their corresponding advantages.\n",
    "   - Estimate the policy gradient $\\vec{g}_{pg}$ from these episodes.\n",
    "   - Update the model parameters:  \n",
    "     $\\theta \\leftarrow \\theta + \\eta \\vec{g}_{pg}$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Code Structure Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "The code you will see is structured directly following this recipe. It boils down to three main components:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Episode Generation**  \n",
    "   - Generate $ (x, y) $ pairs along with their advantages for each RL iteration.\n",
    "   \n",
    "2. **Reward Calculation**  \n",
    "   - Compute rewards for each generated response.\n",
    "   \n",
    "3. **Policy Gradient Estimation**  \n",
    "   - Use the generated episodes to estimate the policy gradient and perform the model update.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the end, these three components come together in a simple loop that trains the model, step by step, to develop reasoning capabilities through reinforcement learning.\n"

    "The goal of episode generation is to create a collection of query-response pairs that will be used for policy training. From the reinforcement learning (RL) perspective, the **query** serves as the initial state, and the generated tokens in the **response** represent the actions taken by the policy.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `create_training_episodes` function takes a list of prompts (initial states) and their corresponding completions which we generate using the model.  In GRPO, we always generate multiple responses per prompt—specifically, `GENERATIONS_PER_SAMPLE` > 1. This means that, after episode generation, we end up with `batch_size × GENERATIONS_PER_SAMPLE` episodes in every RL iteration.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Advantage Computation\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to generating episodes, `create_training_episodes` is also responsible for computing the **advantage** for every response token. \n",
    "\n",
    "In RL terms, the advantage of a token represents how much better or worse that token's action is compared to the average generate token at that specific state (prompt + prefix). Ideally, we would compute an advantage for every token individually to capture how each step contributes to the overall reward.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, in GRPO, there's no per-token advantage computation. Instead, we compute a single advantage value per response. This value reflects how good the entire response is relative to other responses generated for the same prompt. We then assign this single advantage value uniformly to all tokens within that response.\n",
    "\n",
    "GRPO uses a simple formula for this:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. For each prompt $x$ with a group of generated responses $y_1, y_2, \\ldots, y_G \\sim \\pi(\\cdot|x)$, compute their rewards $R_1, R_2, \\ldots, R_G$.\n",
    "2. Compute the group's mean and standard deviation:  \n",
    "   $ \\mu = \\text{mean}(R_1, R_2, \\ldots, R_G) $  \n",
    "   $ \\sigma = \\text{std}(R_1, R_2, \\ldots, R_G) $\n",
    "3. Compute a **relative score** for each response:  \n",
    "   $ R^*_i = \\frac{R_i - \\mu}{\\sigma} $\n",
    "4. Assign this relative score $R^*_i$ as the advantage to all tokens of the $i$-th response:  \n",
    "   $ A_t^{(i)} = R^*_i $\n",
    "\n",
    "This **per-group normalization** encourages responses that are better than average and penalizes those that are worse.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example: Advantage in Action\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider a binary reward scenario where each response is either correct (1) or incorrect (0):\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> rewards = np.array([1, 1, 0, 0, 0])\n",
    ">>> (rewards - rewards.mean()) / (rewards.std())\n",
    "array([ 1.22474487,  1.22474487, -0.81649658, -0.81649658, -0.81649658])\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, the correct responses receive higher advantage scores, promoting them in future updates.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "If only one response is correct:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> rewards = np.array([1, 0, 0, 0, 0])\n",
    ">>> (rewards - rewards.mean()) / (rewards.std())\n",
    "array([ 2. , -0.5, -0.5, -0.5, -0.5])\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This resembles the case where the question in the prompt is too hard and the model is not able to generate a correct response on average.\n",
    "However, if one of the responses is correct, it will be assigned a higher advantage score, and all incorrect responses will be assigned a negative relative score.\n",
    "\n",
    "If all responses are incorrect:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> rewards = np.array([0, 0, 0, 0, 0])\n",
    ">>> (rewards - rewards.mean()) / (rewards.std() + 1e-6)\n",
    "array([0., 0., 0., 0., 0.])\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Since there is no one is better than the average, the model receives no learning signal.\n",
    "\n",
    "If all responses are correct:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> rewards = np.array([1, 1, 1, 1, 1])\n",
    ">>> (rewards - rewards.mean()) / (rewards.std() + 1e-6)\n",
    "array([0., 0., 0., 0., 0.])\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Again, no learning signal is provided because there is nothing to improve upon.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a more mixed case:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> rewards = np.array([1, 1, 1, 1, 0])\n",
    ">>> (rewards - rewards.mean()) / (rewards.std() + 1e-6)\n",
    "array([0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, -2.])\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This represents an easier question for the model. Most responses are correct, but occasional incorrect ones are heavily penalized."

      "`First, let's consider the difference between 97 and the sum of 56 and 3: 97 - (56 + 3) = 97 - 59 = 38. Next, since 38 is less than 4 and 41, we can try subtracting 4 from 38, leaving us with 34. Then, 34 - 3 = 31. However, 31 is not equal to 41. We can try adding 41 to 38 (since 38 * 41 = 1568, which is greater than 97). Now we have 38 + 41 = 79, and subtracting 41 from 97 gives us 97 - 41 = 56. Next, 56 - 38 = 18, where 18 times 4 equals 72, which is greater than 79. So we have 79 - 4 = 75. Now, we have to find a way to get from 75 to 79 using the given numbers.</think>\n",
      "<think>We're ready to combine these results. We can subtract 75 from 97 to get 22.

Now, we can use 4 again by subtracting it from 97 and adding it back in with the other numbers: 97 - 97 + 4 - 56 - 3 - 41 = 2. Finally, adding 4 back in to get to 22, we have 2 + 4 + 4 = 10.

      "    <li>(95 / 50) - 94 = - 87.6</li>\n",
      "</ul>\n",
      "Now here we notice that 74 is not covered by the above. But we notice that 4 and 9 make a 94, and 50 divided by 4 is 22.5 \n",
      "Therefore 22.5 + 94 - 9 = 107.5 which is close but not there yet or maybe 74 is mid way in the result of these calculations and as we noted 107.5 isn't right so we try:\n",

      "<ul>\n",
      "    <li>( 94 - 50) * (9 / 4) = 12.38</li>\n",

      "</ul>\n",
      "Therefore (94 - 50) * 9 / 4 = 41.5, which is getting closer but we need to take the final step to just get to 74:\n",
      "<ul>\n",
      "     <li>( 94 - 50) * 9 / 4 + (94 - 50) / 9 (4) = 42 (0.33)</li>\n",

      "For creating an algorithm-centric AI, the process includes several aspects and steps. Here’s a detailed breakdown of the process:\n",
      "\n",
      "### Step 1: Define the Objectives\n",
      "Firstly, it is crucial to identify the targeted result you want to achieve through your AI development. This is your objective or goal.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Step 2: Research Domain Knowledge\n",
      "After defining the objectives, we must gain a profound understanding of the activity or problem you plan to tackle with AI. This initial phase involves collecting and documenting relevant information, including:\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Data:** Data analytics and data collection are crucial for AI training.\n",
      "- **Technologies:** Researching and choosing from various AI algorithms, frameworks, and libraries.\n",
      "- **Datasets:** If no autonomous data sets are available, develop your own datasets mapping original features to the output classes. This is an iterative process. \n",
      "- **Data Compatibility:** Ensure your AI algorithm can be compatible with your dataset, which is crucial for successful experimentation in AI.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Step 3: Design the Algorithm\n",
      "This phase embodies the decision of which algorithm to implement to achieve the desired goals.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Criteria for Algorithm Selection\n",
      "1. **Predictive Performance:** Given the upper limit of possible results, the algorithm must yield reliable outputs. Evaluating your algorithm’s output can be done using cross-validation techniques to understand how the algorithm might perform.\n",
      "2. **Computational Efficiency:** Efficiency isn't a far reach; it's easy to get stuck without learning or adopting a solution that runs efficiently—and can quickly ramble on if you encounter pitfalls, losing time and productivity in the process.\n",
      "3. **Accessible Learning:** The algorithm should be easy to implement. Leverage resources like libraries, documentation, and tutorials to keep yourself updated.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Step 4: Train the Algorithm\n",
      "The subsequent phase involves creating a training model. Training involves tuning the algorithm to effectively recognize and respond to data. Here, you learn to craft a training strategy to rectify typical mistakes, and includes:\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Data Preprocessing:** This is an essential step, particularly if the dataset is noisy or improperly formatted. Data preprocessing may be needed to transform and transform the data into a suitable format.\n",
      "- **Model Training:** Train the algorithm using the prepared training data. This encompasses tuning algorithm parameters to balance performance against variability, focusing on reducing fault detection rates while handling rare-type scenarios.\n",
      "- **Model Evaluation:** Initiate and evaluate your model across multiple test series. This will enable you to review the precision of outputs, ensuring targets are met and that the model absorbs or learns from test data.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Step 5: Iterate and Improve\n",
      "This continuous improvement phase applies principles like A/B testing, deep learning model expansion, and live data to grow contextual understanding in the application's field.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Step 6: Deployment and Scalability\n",
      "During this phase, your algorithm is implemented to process new data and be fully operational.\n",
      "\n",
      "```python\n",
      "import pickle\n",
      "\n",
      "def read_model(model_file):\n",
      "\treturn pickle.load(open(model_file, 'rb'))\n",
      "\n",
      "def predict(x):\n",
      "\t\"\"\"\n",
      "\tCalculate prediction using trained function model_file\n",
      "\t\"\"\"\n",
      "\tfunction = read_model(model_file)\n",
      "\treturn function.predict(x)\n",
      "\n",
      "model_file = 'MY-MODEL.pkl'\n",
      "result = predict(my_input_x)\n",
      "print(result)\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "### Step 7: Maintain and Update\n",
      "In this last step, function needs continuous maintenance. This involves tweaking the model based on varying data patterns to adjust performance. Regularly observe function performance and finish required updates/properly monitor the size of load, and server response times.\n",
      "\n",

I'll then subtract the result from 11 to get an exact 16. So, 96/63 = 1.5432, which rounds down to 1. If I subtract 1 from 11, I get 10. Now, I need to fill in the remaining spots with the numbers and operations. I'll add 3 and 6 (3+6=9) and then divide the result by 5 (9/5=1.8). Since 1.8 is less than 16, I'll subtract it from the last value (10-1.8=8.2). Finally, I'll add 3 (8.2+3=11.2). Although this doesn't match 16, I'll use one of the remaining numbers, so I'll multiply 3 by 6 (3*6=18) and then subtract the result from 11.2 (11.2-18=-6.8).

      "` We need to use the numbers 35, 72, 23, and 3 exactly once to create an equation that equals 10. Let's consider the operations we can use: addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), and division (/). One way to approach this is to try out different combinations until we find the right one. For instance, we could try to divide one number by another and then subtract from it. I'll try dividing 72 by 3 to get 24, and then subtract 23 to get 21. That's close but not our answer. Let's try another combination: dividing 72 by 24 gives us 3, and then subtract 3 from 35 gives us 32, which is too high. Instead, let's try dividing 3 by 23 to get approximately 0.13, and then adding 72 to that gives us almost 72.47. This is getting closer, so let's try a different path. Multiplying 3 by 23 gives us 69, and then dividing that by 72 gives us approximately 0.95. Adding 35 to that would be 38.95, which is still not 10. Aha! Let's try finally: dividing 3 by 72 gives us approximately 0.05, and then adding that to 23 and multiplying by 35 gives us approximately 10. Therefore, the equation that equals 10 is (3 / 72) * 23 + 35.</think>\n",

However, if we subtract one from the 51, we get 49. Then we subtract 25.5 again, which gives us 23.4. Adding 71 and 23.4 equals 94.4, which is very close to 87. To fix this, we can divide 23.4 by 2, which gives us 11.7. Finally, we add 71 and 11.7, which equals 82.8. To get closer to 87, we can add 8 or 9 to any of our numbers.

      "`First, I will consider the options. Using division, we can split 25 and 77. By dividing 25 by 7, we get 6.25, and by dividing 77 by 56, we get 1.4. Subtracting these two numbers gives us 6.25 - 1.4 = 4.85. Adding the remaining numbers 62 and 76, we get 138. The sum of 4.85 and 138 is 142.85, but it is not equal to 66. Using multiplication, I can multiply 25 and 7, giving me 175, which is much larger than 66. Considering subtraction, I can subtract 25 from 77, giving me 22, but it is not equal to 66 either. Instead, I decided to subtract 62 from 76, giving me 14. Adding 14 to 25 gives 39, which is not equal to 66. Finally, I tried to subtract 76 from 77, giving me 1. Adding 1 to 25 gives 26. Adding 26 and 62 equals 88. Then, I thought of multiplying 26 and 62, which gives me 1612. Subtracting 1612 from 76 equals -1536, which is not equal to 66. I then tried to subtract 76 from 77 using division, giving me 77/18.5 = 4.17397. Adding 25, 77, and 62 equals 164. Subtracting 164 from 76 gives me -88, which is not equal to 66. I then thought about adding 25 and 77, giving me 102. Subtracting 62 and 76 equals 14, which gives me 116. Subtracting 116 from 102 gives me -14, which is not equal to 66. Finally, I decided to subtract 77 from 76, giving me -1. Subtracting this from 25, 77, and 62 gives me 98. Dividing 62 by 14 gives me 4.357, which when subtracted from 77 gives 72.743. Subtracting 98 from 72.743 gives me -25.257, which is not equal to 66 either. I then thought about multiplying 25 and 7, giving me 175. Subtracting 175 from 76, I get -99. Half of 66 is 33, so if I add 33 to 77, I get 110. Subtracting 77 from 110 gives me 33. Then, I thought about adding 25 and 62. This equals 87. Reframed as -87, it gives me -66. I then thought about subtracting 62 from 77, giving me 15. Adding 15 to 25 gives 40, which when subtracted from 66 gives me 26. I then subtract 1 from 26, giving me 25, and adding 25 to 77 gives 102. Subtracting 102 from 102 gives me 0, which is not equal to 66. Finally, I thought of adding 62 and 76. This gives me 138. Subtracted from 77 gives me -61. Adding 25 to -61, gives me -36. Adding -36 to 4 times 77 (308) gives me 332. Subtracting 332 from 76, gives me -256, which is not equal to 66. I then thought about adding 25 and 77, which gives me 102. Subtracting 62 and adding 1 to give me 40, and subtracting 40 from 66 gives me -26. I then thought about adding 40 and 77, which gives me 117. Subtracting 117 from 138 gives me 21. Adding 9 to 21 gives me 30. Adding -26 and 30 gives me 4, which when added to `\n",

      "`First, I'll calculate 20 * 40 which equals 800. Then, I can subtract 26 from 800, and that gives me 774. Finally, I'll add 26 to 774, and that results in 800 + 26 = 826. But we need an 86, not an 826. Instead, I'll subtract 20 from 826, which will yield 806. I'll realize I need to adjust it further. Let's try another approach: Diving 20 by 40 gives me 0.5. Now, adding 40 to 0.5 gives me 40.5. Next, subtract 26 from 40.5, which gives 14.5. Lastly, multiplying 14.5 by 2 gives me 29, which is too high. So, I'll subtract 29 from 800, giving me 771. Oh, no, it's too high again. Another way: 20 divided by 40 is 0.5. Adding 0.5 to 40 gives me 40.5. Then, subtract 26 from 40.5, which results in 14.5. Multiplying 14.5 by 2 is 29, still too high. Let's try: 20 divided by 4 gives me 5. Multiplying 5 by 40 gives me 200. Adding 26 to 200 gives me 226. Subtracting 20 from 226 gives me 206. And finally, dividing 206 by 2 gives me 103, which is too high. The only remaining possibility: 800 minus the product of 20 and 2 is 800 - 40 = 760. Adding 26 to 760 gives me 786, which is too high. Hands down, 20 plus 20 divided by 40 gives me 20 + 0.5 = 20.5. Adding 26 to 20.5 gives me 46.5. Multiplying 46.5 by 2 gives me 93, which is lower. So: 800 minus 20 divided by 4 gives me 800 - 5. Multiplying 5 by 20 gives me 100. Adding 26 to 100 gives me 126. And finally, dividing 126 by 2 gives me the final answer. So, the equation is: (20 + (20 / 40)) * 5 = 86.</think>\n",

      "`First, we need to work backwards from the target value of 57. We know that dividing by 3 or 5 wouldn't work as it would result in a smaller number, so we can consider multiplication first. Multiplying 24 by 2 gives us 48/6, which simplifies to 8. Now we need a way to get 57 - 8, which is 49. We notice that 49 can be obtained by 7 * 7 or by dividing by 2 and concatenating, but since we're limited to integer operations and need to use all numbers exactly once, we use multiplication. Multiplying 22 by 1.75 (which is 0.75 + 1) gives us 16.25. Adding 9 still won't give us 49, so instead of adding 9, we can add 9 minus 1, which is 8. So, we have (22 * 1.75) + ( (20 + 9) - 9 ). Double-checking, this works out to 90 + 1 = 57.\n",

      "`First, we need to find the two numbers that can be combined to make 51 when combined with the other two numbers. Since 61 is the largest number, it would be difficult to get a result of 51 by adding or subtracting any two of the remaining numbers (12, 39, and 78). So, let's try multiplication first. 78 * 2 = 156, which is too high. Now, let's try division. 12 / 2 = 6, and 61 - 6 = 55, but we need 51. Let's try subtraction. 61 - 39 = 22. Now, we need a subtraction for 51 - 22, which is 29. However, we only have 12 and 78 left, and neither can give us 29. So, let's try addition. 12 + 78 = 90, which is too high. Lastly, let's try division again. 78 / 12 = 6.5, but that would not give us 51. So, we need to try a different approach. Since we already used all the numbers, we cannot use multiplication again. However, we can try using addition and subtraction in a different order. 61 - 39 = 22, 22 - 12 = 10, and add 78 to 10, which gives us 88, which is not 51. So, let's try a different order. 61 - 12 = 49, and 49 + 78 = 127, which is not 51. Lastly, let's try a subtraction of 78 - 39 = 39, and 39 - 12 = 27, which is not 51. The only remaining option is to use subtraction as the last operation. 61 - 39 = 22, and 22 - 12 = 10, and add (78 - 2) which would not give us 51. Let's try another approach. 61 - 78 = -17, 12 - (-17) = 12 + 17 = 29, and -29 - 39 = -68, which is not 51. Let's try a different approach. 61 - 39 = 22, add 78 - 12 which would not give us 51. Let's try one last approach. 61 - 12 = 49, 49 + 78 = 127 (which is not 51).</think>\n",
